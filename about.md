### Who I am
```bash
[dferrero@github]:~/ $ ./whoiam
-bash: ./whoiam: Permission denied
[dferrero@github]:~/ $ chmod +x whoiam
[dferrero@github]:~/ $ ./whoiam
You should not set +x to all users... ;)
```

I am David, an IT guy focused on security since 2012. I have been working focusing on **Blue Team** with SIEMs, IDS/IPS, vulnerability scanners and analyzing malware. I have also worked as **Red Team** performing penetration tests.

I don't pretend to be a professional mobile developer (mostly iOS), but I like to spend some time learning how to create apps and how they work. If some day I finally finish an app, it will appear on `Projects` section.

Some of my hobbies are listen and play music (I know how to play over six instruments, although I usually do it only three), reading, motorbikes and writing. And that's the reason why I have opened this site.

Main objective of this blog is to write from time to time, so I could practice and improve my English. Please, if you find a typo/misspell/error in any page, I will appreciate a report to fix it.

I will cover three topics on the blog:

* **Security posts**: self-explained.
* **IT posts**: everything related to IT and it has no relation with security.
* **Projects**: although I am not a full-time open source developer and I prefer to spend my free time with other hobbies, sometimes I have (maybe) interesting ideas which I want to develop and make it "real". Those who survives and I think they could be interesting for other people will be explained in this section.
