In the next article we cover multiple topics related with Wordpress. It could be used as a full guide or as a reference related to a specific subject. 

All technical instructions are specified for Debian 9.

Here is the index with all points:

- [Secure installation](#secure-installation)
- [Virtual hosts configuration](#virtual-hosts-configuration)
- [Let's Encrypt setup](#lets-encrypt-setup)
- [Enabling HTTPS in Wordpress](#enabling-https-in-wordpress)

## Secure installation

We could find online thousands of tutorials covering this topic, but it's hard to find one where you don't install old (and unsecure) software.

Main problem here is PHP version hosted in repositories. Usually, the standard installation will be 5.6.x (maybe 7.0.x if you are lucky), which is a kind of lottery [in terms of security](https://www.cvedetails.com/version-list/74/128/6/PHP-PHP.html?sha=0bb72d05caaf4fdd8d5e6106ced1cadc8a6e1095&order=1&trc=1127). Unless you need a extremely specific version because of plugins you'll need for Wordpress, **you should install the latest version available**.

Here is a summary of all steps for a fresh installation, including PHP 7.3.

#### Core packages
```
apt-get update
apt-get install apache2 mysql-server

# Remove apache2 info file
rm -f /var/www/html/index.html
# Minimal secure performance related to SQL
mysql_secure_installation
``` 

#### PHP 7.3

If we perform a search like `apt-cache search php7.3`, probably we will get no results. In this case, we have to add a new repository to our sources list:

```echo "deb http://mirrordirector.raspbian.org/raspbian/ buster main contrib non-free rpi" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/10-buster.list```

Create a file with the next content:
```
vi /etc/apt/preferences.d/10-buster	
#-----------
Package: *
Pin: release n=stretch
Pin-Priority: 900

Package: *
Pin: release n=buster
Pin-Priority: 750
#-----------
```

Now install the last version of PHP hosted in the added repository:
```
apt-get update
apt install -y -t buster php7.3-fpm php7.3-curl php7.3-gd php7.3-intl php7.3-mbstring php7.3-mysql php7.3-imap php7.3-opcache php7.3-sqlite3 php7.3-xml php7.3-xmlrpc php7.3-zip php7.3-bcmath php-apcu libapache2-mod-php7.3
```

#### Wordpress

Download with `wget` or `curl` the last version of Wordpress:
```
cd /tmp
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
mv wordpress/ /var/www/html
```

Now you can open a browser, navigate to "http://<your_ip_address>/wordpress" and perform the final installation with Wordpress' wizard.

## Let's Encrypt setup

In order to enable HTTPS into Wordpress, one of the requirements is to have installed a certification signed by a trusted Certification Authority (CA). If we are not a big company, the best and cheapest option is use one of 



## Virtual hosts configuration

Apache - Virtualhost
```
	cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
	vi sitename.conf
	-----------
	<VirtualHost *:80>
	        ServerName domainname.com
	        ServerAlias www.domainname.com

	        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
	        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/path/folder

	        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/domainname-error.log
	        CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/domainname-access.log combined

	</VirtualHost>
	-----------
	a2ensite sitename.conf
	/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
```

MySQL
```
	CREATE DATABASE databasename;
	CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'user_password';
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON databasename.* TO "wordpressusername"@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY "password";
	FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
